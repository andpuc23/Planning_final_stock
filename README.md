# Planning_final_stock
Repo for final project at Planning Algorithms course at My University.

## Description
We want to build an reinforcement learning algorithm to trade stocks with maximum efficiency. To do this, we use:
- Rapidly exploring random tree (RRT)
- Value Iteration (VI)

### If we are good:
- Deep Q-learing
- Temporal difference
- Model-predictive control

## Stucture of our project
- `data` folder holds the data we train and test on
- `utils` contains some useful functions, i.e. to prepare data for models
- `models` folder has subfolders dedicated to each algorithm we use
- `pipeline.ipynb` is the main file which runs the whole stuff

## Authors
Todo, see collaborators :D
